The friends went through the forest.
They discovered a house in the woods made of candy.
They were hungry, so they started to eat parts of the house.
They were stopped by a scary looking witch, who scolded them for eating her house.
The friends apologized, and the witch invited them inside to eat and rest, as they were tired from their journey. 
However, the witch had bad intentions, and was fattening them up to eat them later.
Realizing this, the friends made their escape.
They pushed the witch into her own cauldron of boiling water and ran away.
They decided it was time to go home.
